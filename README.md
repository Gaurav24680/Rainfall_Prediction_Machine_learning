# Rainfall_Prediction_Machine_learning
This project aims to predict rainfall based on historical weather data obtained from Kaggle. Various machine learning models were used to analyze and predict rainfall patterns effectively.
The dataset contains weather-related features such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, pressure, and other meteorological parameters.
The data was preprocessed, cleaned, and normalized to improve model accuracy.
Technologies Used:-
Python
Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
Scikit-learn
